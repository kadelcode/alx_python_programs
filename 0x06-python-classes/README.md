# Background Context
OOP is a totally new concept for all of you (especially who think they know about it :)). It's VERY important that you read at least all the material that is listed below (and skip what we recommend you to skip, you will see them later in the curriculum).

As usual, make sure you type (never copy and paste), test, understand all examples shown in the following links (including those in the video), test again etc. The biggest and most important takeaway of this project is: experiment by yourself OOP, play with it!
