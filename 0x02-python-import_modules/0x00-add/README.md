-	A program that import the function _def add(a,b):_ from the file _add_0.py_ and prints the result of the addition *1 + 2 = 3*
	-	You have to use _print_ function with string format to display integers
	-	You have to assign:
		-	The value _1_ to a variable called _a_
		-	The value _2_ to a variable called _b_
		-	And use those two variables as arguments when calling the functions _add_ and _print_
	-	*a* and *b* must be defined in 2 different lines: _a = 1_ and another _b = 2_
	-	Your program should print: *<a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value>* followed with a new line
	-	You can only use the word _add_0_ once in your code
	-	You are not allowed to use _*_ for import or __import__
	-	Your code should not be executed when imported - by using __import__
