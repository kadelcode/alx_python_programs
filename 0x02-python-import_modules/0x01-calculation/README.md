### 1-calculation
-	A python program that imports functions from the file *calculator_1.py* , does some Maths,and prints the result
	-	Do not use the function _print_ (with string format to display integers) more than 4 times
	-	You have to define:
		-	the value *10* to a variable _a_
		-	the value *5* to a variable _b_
		-	and use those two variables only, as arguments when calling functions(including _print_)
	-	*a* and *b* must be defined in 2 different lines: _a = 10_ and another _b = 5_
	-	Your program should call each of the imported functions
	-	The word *calculator_1* should be used only once in your file
	-	You are not allowed to use _*_ for importing or *__import__*
	-	YOur code should not be executed when imported
