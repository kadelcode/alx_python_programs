### 2-args.py
Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments (*Done*)
-	The output should be:
	-	Number of arguments(s) followed by ```argument``` (if number is one) or ```arguments``` (otherwise), followed by
	-	(or ```.``` if no arguments were passed) followed by
	-	a new line, followed by (if at least one argument),
	-	one line per argument:
		-	the position of the argument (starting at ```1```) followed by ```:```, followed by the argument value and a new line
-	Your code should not be executed when imported
-	The number of elements of _argv_ can be retrieve by using: _len(argv)_
-	You do not have to fully understand lists yet, but imagine that _argv_ can be used just like a C array: you can use an index to walk through it. There are other ways (which will be preferred for future project tasks), if you know them you can use them.
