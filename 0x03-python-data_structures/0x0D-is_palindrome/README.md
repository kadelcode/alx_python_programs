### Technical interview preparation:
	-	You are not allowed to google anything
	-	Whiteboard first

-	Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome
	-	Prototype: _int is_palindrome(listint_t **head);_
	-	Return: _0_ if it is not a palindrome, _1_ if it is a palindrome
	-	An empty list is considered a palindrome
