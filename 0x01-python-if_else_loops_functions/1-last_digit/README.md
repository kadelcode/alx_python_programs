This program will assign a random signed number to the variable ```number``` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable ```number```.
- You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01.py/blob/master/1-last_digit_py)
- The variable ```number``` will store a different value every time you will run this program
- You donâ€™t have to understand what ```import```, ```random.randint``` do. **Please do not touch this code**. This line should not change: ```number = random.randint(-10000, 10000)```
- The output of the program should be:
  - The string ```Last digit of```, followed by
  - the number, followed by
  - the string ```is```, followed by the last digit of ```number```, followed by
    - if the last digit is greater than 5: the string ```and is greater than 5```
    - if the last digit is 0: the string ```and is 0```
    - if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string ```and is less than 6 and not 0```
  - followed by a new line
