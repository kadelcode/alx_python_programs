Write a program that prints all numbers from ```0``` to ```98``` in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example)
- You can only use one ```print``` function with string format
- You can only use one loop in your code
- You are not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable
- You are not allowed to import any module
```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./4-print_hexa.py
0 = 0x0
1 = 0x1
2 = 0x2
3 = 0x3
4 = 0x4
5 = 0x5
6 = 0x6
7 = 0x7
8 = 0x8
9 = 0x9
10 = 0xa
11 = 0xb
12 = 0xc
13 = 0xd
14 = 0xe
15 = 0xf
16 = 0x10
17 = 0x11
18 = 0x12
...
96 = 0x60
97 = 0x61
98 = 0x62
